00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,750
thanks to last past for sponsoring a portion of this video.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,880
More from them later.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,360
we build a lot of high performance computers around here,

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,550
but today is going to be different.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,560
We scoured the Internet for the slowest brand new components that money can buy,

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,050
and we're gonna build it right here right now.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,780
Then for comparison.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:36,050
We also grab some sort of what I would consider to be budget components but sensible ones to see just how much more performance you can get if you balance your budget,

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,250
it's really the packaging for that.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,160
We're gonna get to that bit later,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,490
though.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,350
First,

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,970
don't worry,

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,400
parts aren't in there already to throw that in joke.

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,550
Of course,

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,350
my expectations may end up being subverted and our slowest possible computer.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,550
Where's the CPU?

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,140
Maybe this will end up being an amazing bang for the buck,

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,610
starting with our A M D Athlon 3000 G.

21
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:21,220
So this poppy right here is a 3.5 gigahertz dual core that's not really impressive for 2020.

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,500
And making matters worse,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,290
this is based on Andy's older Zen architecture rather than Zen,

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,850
too.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,420
But hey,

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,650
for $55 plus could actually includes a cooler,

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,330
I guess you know,

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,510
it's hard to really.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,700
It's hard to really complain.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,920
Like how is this a few 50 bucks for our mother board?

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,540
We've gone with Emma size a 3:20 a.m. A throw.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,320
So this is about as entry level as it gets for an A M for mother board.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,860
You've got just too damn slots,

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,130
although that will be enough for us to run dual channel,

35
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,950
assuming that our budget allows it,

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,610
which it doesn't because we're building the slowest possible computer has a PC.

37
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,810
I express 60 next Gen three graphics card slot.

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,240
We will be installing a graphics card and then you've got onboard video in case you want to use in a pew.

39
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,600
Wow,

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,820
most PS two ports tank.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,350
No enviably for us today,

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,830
folks.

43
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,250
We're not even using an SSD,

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,160
and it feels like this should contribute to it being slow.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,870
But honestly,

46
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,880
with just two cores,

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,390
I'm expecting fist into a pretty decent job of cooling.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,480
I feel like I should clarify that the parts that we picked were not necessarily the slowest ones that we could find,

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,970
but rather that we limited ourselves to things that are currently in production.

50
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:49,500
So the slowest brand new and technically modern parts that you can build naturally no slowest possible build would be complete without a single stick of DDR four memory.

51
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,550
The CPU does have a dual channel memory controller,

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,050
but I mean,

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,350
if we're looking for the bare minimum to fire up the machine and get into Windows four Gigs of Ram,

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,840
that's it.

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,490
Wow,

56
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,550
you sure can build a computer quickly when there's not much in it.

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,590
We're halfway there already.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,070
Between our CPU Mother Board of Ram,

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,760
we've spent ah,

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,270
$125.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,090
That's less than like a gaming motherboards.

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,840
But while you guys might think that I'm impressed by that,

63
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:31,890
I'm actually kind of worried for the prospects of our slowest possible computer here because CPU ran the mother board on the second hand market pool.

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,320
We let me tell you,

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,050
I could get some better stuff than that.

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,800
You know,

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,740
that's what kind of drives me crazy about this entry level hardware as it gets branded.

68
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,010
Really,

69
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,860
what it is is,

70
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,670
in my opinion,

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,010
basically e waste because you might say,

72
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,410
Well,

73
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,710
you know,

74
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,940
not everyone wants to put the work in tow,

75
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,680
putting together something second hand,

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,350
but it's not even a ton of work.

77
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,120
I mean,

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:06,000
we did that video recently where we took an old Dell OptiPlex basically through a graphics card in it for less than what we're going to spend on this complete brand new machine.

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,830
And let me tell you,

80
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,850
a spoiler alert,

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,230
this thing is going to run.

82
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,210
What's the opposite of running circles around something?

83
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,150
For our case,

84
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,940
we've got a thermal take H 17 which at the time was priced the same as the deep cool,

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,780
not tracks that we had originally chosen.

86
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,210
So $35 point is,

87
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,330
that's about the cheapest you can get unless it's on fire sale for a brand new computer case and then for our power supply.

88
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,400
We've got a Corsair CV 5 50 This is your entry level.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,610
Hey,

90
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,200
I don't want my computer to blow up.

91
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,380
That would be a bad thing kind of power supply if you could get power supplies for $13 or whatever.

92
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,740
But even on a system like this,

93
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,380
I would not recommend plugging them in.

94
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,000
And what's the point of ruining stuff?

95
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,680
Huh?

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,640
Four whole screws to put in power split.

97
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,150
Jeepers,

98
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,500
you just need to rehydrate El Sisi stored.

99
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,190
So this is cool.

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,050
Kind of like an SSD,

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,320
except just with some rubber grommets should just mount your hard drive like that.

102
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,840
So I put in all the screws.

103
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,120
I mean,

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,300
there's really not that many of them.

105
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,960
We had a second fan that we intended to install in this puppy,

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,510
but I don't think we're gonna be doing that because there's only a single fan header aside from the CPU fan had her on this mother board.

107
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
More simplicity,

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,640
foam fat installed.

109
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,590
Cable managed is actually pretty nice for a budget case.

110
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,090
Hey.

111
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,430
Wow.

112
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,940
We've got USB three on both our cases and mother board.

113
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,550
I'm sure you guys a little trick.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,150
You could just take all of these little individual pieces and kind of make your own block of connectors.

115
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,600
If you line up just right.

116
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,100
Put it on just like that.

117
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,360
How on dang it.

118
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,520
I stabbed my thumb.

119
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:53,990
I'm good.

120
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,880
Fine.

121
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,710
24 pin power connector.

122
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,550
Just like that,

123
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,540
you can see instead of an eight pin power connector on this board,

124
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,560
we've got just a four pin.

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,950
So we're gonna split apart are eight pin power connector.

126
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,430
Just pop half of it into their This is crazy.

127
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,250
Like if I was actually trying to speed build this,

128
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,330
I think I could do it in under five minutes.

129
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,520
And now for the PS,

130
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,810
tell a resistance our Zo tack G t to 10.

131
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,030
This was a slow graphics card when I was still working at N.

132
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,020
C I X House.

133
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,920
Like eight years ago,

134
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,110
you could still buy them.

135
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,070
I don't even get it.

136
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,850
People who buy a card like this don't care about performance at all,

137
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:43,370
or they get kind of screwed into it because they don't know that the performance of a $50 card is not half of the performance of $100 card.

138
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,190
I remember talking to Zo Tak about these cards back when I was working in sex.

139
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,490
I was like,

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,610
Well,

141
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,250
who the crap is buying these things like,

142
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,110
Well,

143
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,340
you know,

144
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,580
best.

145
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,030
Buy's moving through them by the truckload,

146
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,540
and I was like,

147
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,910
Why are their sales people selling these to them?

148
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,050
It's a terrible value point of clarification.

149
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,870
This is 40 U.

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,050
S.

151
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,400
Dollars,

152
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,990
not 50 and it's still a bad deal.

153
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,500
Yeah,

154
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,530
for $35 case,

155
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:06,810
I mean,

156
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm liking it crazily enough.

157
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,250
That was it.

158
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,230
By the way,

159
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,650
the key night among you might have noticed that we had an 80 radion fan installed on that graphics card.

160
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,440
That's cause we weren't gonna go out and buy another GT 2 10 just to make this video.

161
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,600
It's one that we already had.

162
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,940
And it's one that the fan failed on a long time ago.

163
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,880
And we just kind of food,

164
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,670
whatever on there,

165
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,450
as long as it runs cool enough time to fire it up.

166
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,110
I miss a little wine.

167
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,410
E g few fans up.

168
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,050
It works.

169
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,160
That took a hot minute to posted it.

170
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,660
Fire up some CS go,

171
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,080
shall we?

172
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,050
And while we wait for the game to load cause it will probably take a minute on the mechanical drive,

173
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,950
we're going to go ahead and pull out our better value gaming PC here.

174
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:05,940
Our slowest PC came in at a price of just over $300 while our step up model came in at just under 600 which is a pretty substantial increase.

175
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,220
We're spending almost twice as much,

176
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,300
but We're also getting more than twice as much computer.

177
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,340
So we're going all the way up to a rise in 3100 which happens to be based on their Zen to architecture.

178
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,010
That is going to be a big performance boost for gaming.

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,760
We managed to double our rant,

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,360
going from 4 to 8 gigs,

181
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
which also means now it's running in dual channel mode.

182
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,350
We've got a more feature rich mother board and,

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:30,760
ah,

184
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,310
big amount of our budget was spent on this puppy right here.

185
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,290
So we've gone with an Rx 5 70 which is maybe,

186
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,730
you know,

187
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,290
last gen.

188
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,980
At this point,

189
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,440
but still a very,

190
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
very respectable budget gaming card.

191
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,370
If we're running a 10 80 p already,

192
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,910
just how much faster and boots Apple launches games is a huge difference for this one.

193
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,460
But of course,

194
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,650
that's what happens when you spend a little bit of extra on an SSD.

195
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,060
And the funny thing about an SSD is that these days it doesn't actually cost that much extra.

196
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,360
If you look for the right deal,

197
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,050
we got our fatted of racing 1 20 gig SSD for 20 bucks.

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,750
Eight.

199
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,740
Ex ante releasing eight happen Let's see if that helps a little bit.

200
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,710
Gonna set the settings over here the same.

201
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,320
Oh,

202
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,540
man,

203
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,250
this one defaulted to for Okay.

204
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,380
Ooh,

205
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,190
lordy.

206
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,680
Fly.

207
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,820
That's still loading.

208
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,430
Holy crap!

209
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,700
150.

210
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,250
60 70 200 FPs.

211
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,750
Yep,

212
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,760
This feels this feels pretty good.

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,210
All right,

214
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,580
this one's loaded up.

215
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,730
Now let's just make sure the resolutions,

216
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,100
right?

217
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,320
And this kid's is why friends don't let friends by entry level graphics cards.

218
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,410
We are getting 10 FPs.

219
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,240
My ladies and gentlemen's we're charging in.

220
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,950
Though We're charging in,

221
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,550
we might have something.

222
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,610
I got one 10 FPs gaming.

223
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,450
Ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,250
come on.

225
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,440
But friends got it out for me.

226
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:21,400
So the lesson we're learning here is that spending twice as much can yield Mawr than just twice the performance improvement in this case,

227
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,700
we're looking at about anywhere from 50 next to 20 x,

228
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,370
the performance at the same settings and actually missed another thing that is twice as fast about our higher end system.

229
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,690
It's got USB 3 10 gig instead of five gigs.

230
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,710
So if you really wanted to transfer things quickly over USB,

231
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,320
you could do that.

232
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:39,810
Oh,

233
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,200
no.

234
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,030
There's a first time set up on this one while we wait for that one to complete set up,

235
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,250
we can go ahead and have a look at what our rocket league performances like.

236
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,930
Yes,

237
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,280
I'm playing with most keyboard.

238
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm sorry.

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,590
00 I press jump instead of go fast.

240
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,030
Well,

241
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,710
that's a shame.

242
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,320
OK,

243
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,080
so what are we looking?

244
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,180
We're looking at 100 plus FPs with a minimum of 48 the entire time we've been planning here.

245
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:12,520
And that minimum is honestly mawr important to the gaming experience than that averages rocket leg.

246
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,780
Is this game just not even gonna launch?

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:15,930
Nope.

248
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,650
New plan.

249
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,350
Just for the sake of giving our slowest PC,

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,000
it's best possible shot.

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,750
We actually ripped the graphics card.

252
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,620
That wasn't letting us launch the game out.

253
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,650
And we're running off of the onboard graphics.

254
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:40,520
The problem with that is that we're running a single stick of memory because it's a bit of a Miss configured machine and now r a p U graphics has to share memory bend with with the CPU,

255
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,310
which was already half of what it ideally would be.

256
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,750
15 FPs in the menu.

257
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,150
Big goof Linus.

258
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,950
That same settings is the other one.

259
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,180
Oh boy,

260
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,440
You know,

261
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,810
having the game run in slow motion like this is actually kind of nice,

262
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,560
because it's not an online match.

263
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,360
So I think the game is actually running slow.

264
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,890
Finally,

265
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,700
let's go for a good old fashioned center bench drag race.

266
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,660
Are you gonna Are you even trying?

267
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,470
Maybe it didn't register and the 123 go.

268
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,160
I think we've all seen enough,

269
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,460
and I think we've all learned the lesson that we're trying to teach here.

270
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,650
Just because something is brand new off the shelf doesn't mean that it is a viable option for building a system.

271
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,300
And you might say,

272
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:26,940
Well,

273
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,380
look,

274
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,630
I've only got $50 to spend on a CPU,

275
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,700
and that's fine,

276
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,750
and that's fair.

277
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:44,690
But your best option at that point is to go back and look for something on the second hand market that is going to give you a better experience than this literally ah,

278
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:54,560
fraction of the speed of even a value chip like the rise and 3 31 100 really fantastic CPU for the money.

279
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,200
The other thing is graphics.

280
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,490
You know how there's a point of diminishing returns when you go into the very high end stuff.

281
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,020
Well,

282
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,500
there's a point of diminishing returns at the low end as well,

283
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,320
and it's something people don't really think about.

284
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,950
So I would give the same advice there.

285
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,560
In fact,

286
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,210
I don't want you to get discouraged if you've only got $300 to spend on a new computer.

287
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:22,380
What I want you to do is head down to the comments where some of our sad e bargain hunter viewers are gonna post some grapes back lists that they think they can put together for $300.

288
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,460
Because I guarantee you,

289
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
if you head up eBay,

290
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Craigslist in all those kinds of places,

291
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,280
it can be done now for the portion of this video that is sponsored by last past.

292
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,480
Last Pass is the password manager that I use and honestly,

293
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,530
whether it's for personal use or for our corporate use,

294
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,100
I absolutely love it.

295
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,910
The corporate version has all kinds of tools that we can use to manage access to all the different accounts and not just accounts,

296
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,240
but little notes or credit card numbers,

297
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,160
or anything else that our staff needs access to no matter where they are and to do it securely and then for personal use.

298
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,800
Well,

299
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,680
it's great whether I'm using a PC and Android phone or an iPhone.

300
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,790
All I've got to do is enter one password and everything that I need is right at my fingertips.

301
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm gonna just check and see if there's any talking points that I'm supposed.

302
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,950
I'm just talking about what I like about last pass right now.

303
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,400
Oh,

304
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:15,580
yeah,

305
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,860
it's way more secure,

306
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,700
because that way you only have to remember one really strong pass phrase,

307
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,140
and you never have to use duplicate passwords because,

308
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,620
let's face it,

309
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,370
who can remember all the literally hundreds of passwords that you have to have these days last past?

310
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,870
Auto fills your credentials through browser extensions or Absalon Mobile.

311
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,970
And if you go to last past Premium,

312
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,110
they've got advanced features like multi factor authentication options and emergency access.

313
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,830
So go check them out at the link.

314
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,070
In the video description,

315
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,190
I've been using them for years.

316
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,270
I've been super happy,

317
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,510
thanks last past for being awesome and thanks last pass for sponsoring this video.

318
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,480
If you guys enjoy this sort of thing and you're looking to maybe go a little bit deeper than the comments on this video to build a great value gaming rig,
